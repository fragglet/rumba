.TH tumba_nmbd 8
.SH NAME
tumba_nmbd \- Minimalist NetBIOS name server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tumba_nmbd
.RB [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B tumba_nmbd
is a minimalist implementation of the NetBIOS name service (NBNS) as described
in RFC 1001.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
The following command line options are understood:
.TP
\fB-b addr\fR
Bind to given IP address. By default the server binds to \fB0.0.0.0\fR, serving
requests from any network interface, but this argument can be used to bind only
to a specific interface.
.TP
\fB-C comment\fR
Include the given description of the server in browse announcements. This is
shown in "Network Neighborhood" on Windows machines if the "Details" view is
selected. If not specified, the default comment will include the system
hostname and the server version.
.TP
\fB-d level\fR
Change the logging level. Values here are: 0 (error); 1 (warning); 2 (notice);
3 (info); 4 (debugging messages). By default errors and warnings are logged.
.TP
\fB-n name\fR
Specify the hostname to announce. If not specified, the system hostname (ie.
the output of the \fBhostname\fR(1) command) is used.
.TP
\fB-l logfile\fR
Specify path to a log file to write log messages.
.TP
\fB-p port\fR
Listen on the given UDP port. By default, \fBTumba\fR listens on port 137, the
NetBIOS name service port.
.TP
\fB-W workgroup\fR
Specify the workgroup to which this server belongs. By default this is
\fBWORKGROUP\fR, the default used in Windows.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
Here are some examples for how to invoke the program:
.TP
tumba_nmbd -W IBMPEERS -b 192.168.30.1
Runs with the workgroup name set to IBMPEERS, the default used by OS/2 Warp.
The server will bind to the \fB192.168.30.1\fR address, only serving requests
on that network interface.
.TP
tumba_nmbd -n DEEPTHOUGHT -C "Lunkwill's workstation"
Manually sets the hostname and server comment
.SH LIMITATIONS
\fBtumba_nmbd\fR is a companion to the \fBtumba_smbd\fR, which is a minimalist
implementation of the SMBv1 file sharing protocol. It intentionally omits many
features of the NBNS protocol that are not needed for that purpose. For
example, compared to Samba's \fBnmbd\fR(1) it does not implement:
.IP \(bu
NetBIOS to DNS mapping
.IP \(bu
Being a master browser server; \fBtumba_nmbd\fR will broadcast hostname
announcements but does not track announcements from other hosts or respond to
queries for names other than its own hostname.
.IP \(bu
LMHOSTS files
.PP
If these features are needed, the Samba \fBnmbd\fR server can be used instead,
even if \fBtumba_smbd\fR is being used as an SMB server (the SMB/NMB servers
from the Samba and Tumba projects can be arbitrarily mixed and matched)

.SH HISTORY
NetBIOS originated with \fBThe IBM PC Network\fR, IBM's first PC LAN system.
NetBIOS itself is an API and can be used with multiple different protocols; in
the 1980s and early 1990s the most common were NetBIOS frames (NBF; sometimes
inaccurately called NetBEUI) and Novell's IPX suite. In 1987, RFC 1001 was
published, which defined \fBNetBIOS over TCP/IP\fR (NBT); this allows NetBIOS
applications to run over the TCP/IP protocol suite.
.PP
NetBIOS as an API refers to network hosts by name, and the NetBIOS Name
Service (NBNS) provides the means by which these names are resolved to IP
addresses. Unlike DNS, where names are resolved through requests to
authoritative servers, NBNS works in a peer-to-peer fashion with hosts issuing
broadcasts to local network segments (this reflects NetBIOS's origins as a
protocol to be used in LANs rather than the global Internet). Because of the
extensive use of broadcasts, it gained a reputation as a "chatty" protocol.
.PP
Around 1991-1992, Andrew Tridgell released the first versions of \fISamba\fR,
a free software implementation of the SMB protocol for Unix systems. Since SMB
is based on NetBIOS, Samba also included \fBnmbd\fR, an implementation of the
NetBIOS name service.
.PP
In late 2024, Simon Howard created \fITumba\fR, a Samba fork that continues
support for the SMBv1 protocol. The initial versions only included the SMB
server (\fBtumba_smbd\fR(1)), but \fBtumba_nmbd\fR was subsequently added to
make it a complete standalone suite. It is based on the version of \fBnmbd\fR
that shipped with the Samba v1.8.05 release.
